/** @mainpage
 * SMT-RAT is a toolbox which is specifically tailored to be used by an SMT solver in order to solve non-linear real arithmetic (NRA) efficiently.  NRA is an important but hard-to-solve theory and
 * only a fragment of it can be handled by some of the currently existing SMT solvers.  The toolbox consists of four modules, implementing the
 * virtual substitution method, the cylindrical algebraic decomposition method, a Groebner bases simplifier and a general simplifier, respectively. The intention of the toolbox is that an SMT-compliant theory solver can be achieved by composing these modules according to a user defined strategy and with the goal to exploit their advantages.
 * Furthermore, it supports the addition of further modules implementing other methods dealing with real arithmetic.
