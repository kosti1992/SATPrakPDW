Implements the SMT compliant \emph{Simplex} method presented in \cite{DM06}.
Hence, this module can decide the consistency of any conjunction
consisting only of linear real arithmetic constraints. Furthermore,
it might also find the consistency of a conjunction of constraints
even if they are not all linear and calls a backend after removing
some redundant linear constraints, if the linear constraints are satisfiable
and the found solution does not satisfy the non-linear constraints. Note that the 
\lraModuleClass might need to communicate a lemma/tautology to a preceding 
\satModuleClass, if it receives a constraint with the relation symbol $\neq$
 and the strategy needs for this reason to define a \satModuleClass at any 
 position before an \lraModuleClass.

\paragraph{Integer arithmetic} In order to find integer solutions, this
module applies, depending on which settings are used, branch-and-bound,
the construction of Gomory cuts and the generation of cuts from 
proofs~\cite{DilligDA11}. It is also supported to combine these approaches. Note that
for all of them the \lraModuleClass needs to communicate a lemma/tautology to a
preceding \satModuleClass and the strategy needs for this reason to define a 
\satModuleClass at any position before an \lraModuleClass.

\paragraph{Efficiency} The worst case complexity of the implemented
approach is exponential in the number of variables occurring in the
problem to solve. However, in practice, it performs much faster, and
the worst case applies only on very artificial examples. This module
outperforms any module implementing a method that is designed for 
solving formulas with non-linear constraints. If the received formula
contains integer valued variables, the aforementioned methods might not
terminate.
