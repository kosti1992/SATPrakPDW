This module abstracts it's received formula, being any SMT formula of the supported logics of \smtrat, to it's Boolean skeleton. It thereby replaces all constraints in the formula by fresh Boolean variables. The resulting propositional formula is then solved with \minisat~\cite{minisat}, where after each completed decision level the constraints belonging to the assigned Boolean variables are checked for consistency by the backends of this module. In the case of inconsistency, the infeasible subsets of the backends are abstracted and then involved in the search for a satisfying solution.

\paragraph{Efficiency} Even though the worst case complexity of this procedure, not considering the complexity of the backend calls, is exponential in the number of variables in the abstracted formula, the procedure is in practice more efficient than any of the theory modules. Hence, it does clearly not form a bottleneck of the SMT solving. However, one should aim at reducing the number and complexity of the theory (backend) calls of this module, which might be influenced by infeasible subsets, which are small and/or involve constraints of earlier decision levels in the SAT solving, and lemmas, which either prune the search space of the SAT solving or ease subsequent theory calls.
