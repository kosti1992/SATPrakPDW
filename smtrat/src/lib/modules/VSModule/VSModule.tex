Implements the \emph{virtual substitution} method for a conjunction of constraints as described in \cite{Article_Corzilius_FCT2011}. This module supports incremental calls, efficient backtracking and infeasible subset generation. Note, that the infeasible subsets are often very small but not necessarily minimal. The implemented approach is not complete, as it maybe cannot decide the satisfiability of a conjunction containing a constraint, which involves a variable with degree $3$ or more. Note, that even if no constraint of such form occurs in the received formula, this module might not be able to determine the consistency of its received formula, as it could create constraints of this form in its solving process. Nevertheless, the implemented approach is efficient compared to other approaches for non-linear real arithmetic conjunctions, and therefore well-suited to be used for solving conjunctions of non-linear real arithmetic constraints before complete approaches have their try. In combination with a backend, this module tries to solve the given problem and calls the backend on problems with less variables.

\paragraph{Efficiency} The worst case complexity of this approach is exponential in the number of real arithmetic variables occurring in the conjunction to solve. It performs especially good on almost linear instances and slightly prefers problems only containing constraints with the relation symbols $\leq$, $\geq$ and $=$. It is often the case, that even if the conjunction to solve contains many not suited constraints, this module can determine the consistency on the basis of a well suited subset of the constraints in this conjunction.
