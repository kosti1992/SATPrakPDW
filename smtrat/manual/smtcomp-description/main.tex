\title{\texttt{SMT-RAT 2.0}}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\texttt{SMT-RAT} is an open-source \texttt{C++} toolbox for strategic and parallel SMT solving
consisting of a collection of SMT compliant implementations of methods for
solving quantifier-free (non)linear real and integer arithmetic as well as
the logics of bit-vectors and uninterpreted functions. A more detailed description of \texttt{SMT-RAT} can be found at \href{https://github.com/smtrat/smtrat/wiki}{\color{blue}https://github.com/smtrat/smtrat/wiki}.

\paragraph{Main solving procedures}

The SAT solving within \texttt{SMT-RAT} takes place in an adaption of the SAT solver \texttt{minisat}~\cite{minisat} and we use it for SMT solving in a less-lazy fashion~\cite{sebastiani2007lazy}.

The main focus of \texttt{SMT-RAT} is nonlinear arithmetic. For the linear constraints we use the Simplex method equipped with (currently very naively implemented) branch-and-bound and cutting-plane procedures as presented in \cite{DM06}. For the nonlinear constraints \texttt{SMT-RAT} uses Gr\"obner bases~\cite{JLCA_CAI13}, virtual substitution~\cite{Article_Corzilius_FCT2011} and the cylindrical algebraic decomposition~\cite{Article_Loup_TubeCAD}. Moreover, it uses interval constraint propagation similar as presented in~\cite{GGIGSC10}, lifting splitting decisions and contraction lemmas to the SAT solving and aided by the aforementioned approaches for nonlinear constraints in case it cannot determine whether a box contains a solution or not. Furthermore, we apply some naive preprocessing, (1) using factorizations and sum-of-square decompositions of polynomials to simplify them and (2) applying substitutions gained by constraints being equations. We also normalize and simplify formulas if it is obvious.
