Tutorial {#tutorial}
====================

As a tutorial, we have a number of small programs that show certain features of CArL.
The code is explained using normal comments and can be compiled using `make tutorial`.

Whenever we want to state that a certain property holds at some point, we will use `assert()` to do so.
