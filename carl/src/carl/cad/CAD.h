/// @todo Fix bug in CAD concerning CAD::removePolynomial().
/*
 * beim Aufschreiben des CAD::removePolynomial-Algorithmus' ist mir aufgefallen, 
 * dass darin ein Teil zu Problemen führen kann, sobald ein Polynom entfernt 
 * wird, während die Elimination nicht vollständig durchgeführt worden war:
 * 
 * Falls ein Eliminationslevel leer ist, nehme ich an, dass die Variable nicht 
 * mehr gebraucht wird und beschneide entsprechend den Sample-Tree. Das ist im 
 * Falle einer unvollständigen Elimination falsch.
 * 1. Lösung: Bestimme a.H.v. den Eingabepolynomen, ob tatsächlich die 
 * vermeintlich überflüssige Variable nicht mehr vorkommt, bevor der Sample-Tree 
 * beschnitten wird.
 * 2. Lösung: Entferne nie Variablen (u.U. ineffizient).
 * 
 * Als schnellen Fix könntest du den Teil in CAD::removePolynomial(pPtr, level, 
 * childrenOnly), der den Sample-Tree löscht, auskommentieren.
